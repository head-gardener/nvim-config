## Install

Run 
```
nvim init.lua
:PackerCompile
:PackerInstall
```
Should be a smooth ride from here.

## Branches

To switch to a safe branch run
```
git checkout safe
```
In safe branch all plugins are disabled, 
leaving only colorscheme, some configs and keymaps.  
I use it for `/root/.config`.
